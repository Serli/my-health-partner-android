These two Android applications have two different goals :

### Learning application :
The learning application (or developper application) will provide data to the learning database. The purpose is to furnish enough data to have a good classification algorithm. The person who uses the application will have to inform the time and the type of the activity that he wants to do. At the end of this time-limit, the data collected will be sent to the server.

### Final application :
The final application will inform users their daily follow-up. For each activity (walking or running), the user will be able to see the steps done and the calories burned.

To get the project, create a new Android Studio Project :
File -> New -> Project From Version Control -> GitHub
